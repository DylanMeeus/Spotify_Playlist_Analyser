Spotify playlist analyser
=====

The goal of this project is to have a django webpage that shows some graphs with information about a users playlists on spotify.
To run this, you will need access to the spotify API. You can get an API key at: developer.spotify.com.

This project is made using the spotipy API for python, which you can install using `pip install spotipy`.

You will need to set some environment variables as well.

```
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=''
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=''
export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=''
```

With the correct information filled in. For more information on how to get started using spotipy, you can read their [documentation](http://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
